# EDA_hotel_booking_project
This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel bookings dataset, which contains information on bookings at two hotels, including guest profiles, booking details, hotel characteristics, and data on cancellations and no-shows.

The objective of this EDA is to uncover trends related to bookings, guest preferences, and revenue and it will be focused on the following questions:

1. **Preferred Hotel Type:** Identifying whether guests favor city or resort hotels.
2. **Booking Lead Time Trends:** Examining lead time variations across years and their link to cancellations.
3. **Guest Nationality:** Determining which country has the highest number of guests.
4. **Meal Preferences:** Analyzing the distribution of meal plan choices.
5. **Revenue Insights:** Exploring the relationship between the average daily rate (ADR) and the total number of guests.
6. **Peak Booking Year:** Identifying the year with the highest number of bookings.
7. **Top Revenue Channels:** Understanding which distribution channels contribute most to ADR and revenue.
8. **ADR Monthly Variation:** Observing how ADR fluctuates across months.
9. **Cancellation Trends:** Identifying the distribution channel with the highest cancellation rates.
10. **Repeat Guests:** Finding which channel attracts the most repeat guests.
11. **Market Segments:** Analyzing the distribution of booking market segments and channels.
12. **Guests with Babies:** Examining their distribution across hotel types and cancellation rates.
13. **Seasonal Arrival Trends:** Understanding hotel arrivals by year and month.

The EDA process will begin with data cleaning to handle missing or erroneous data, ensuring accuracy in analysis. After cleaning, various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps will be used to identify patterns and correlations.

Scatter plots will help examine numerical relationships, such as ADR and total guests. Histograms will visualize distributions, such as the frequency of bookings by country or meal type. Heatmaps will highlight correlations between factors like lead time and cancellations.

By analyzing these trends, the study aims to provide insights that can help hotels optimize operations, improve guest satisfaction, and maximize revenue. Understanding guest behaviors, preferred distribution channels, and cancellation patterns will enable data-driven decision-making.

In summary, this EDA will provide a comprehensive overview of hotel booking trends, offering valuable insights into factors influencing revenue, occupancy, and guest preferences.

# **Problem Statement**


Have you ever found yourself wondering when is the perfect time to book a hotel room for the best price? Or how the length of your stay might influence your daily rate? What if hotels could predict whether they are likely to receive an unusually high number of special requests? These are not just questions for curious travelersâ€”they are crucial insights for hotel managers looking to optimize revenue, enhance guest satisfaction, and streamline operations.

To answer these pressing questions, this study leverages a comprehensive hotel booking dataset, offering a deep dive into booking patterns, guest behaviors, and revenue trends. By analyzing this dataset, we can uncover the key factors influencing pricing strategies, occupancy rates, and customer preferences. This exploration will provide valuable insights for both the hospitality industry and consumers, helping them make more informed decisions.
